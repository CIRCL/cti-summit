[Cerebrate](https://www.cerebrate-project.org/) is a new open source tool, built under the [MeliCERTes](https://github.com/melicertes/docs) umbrella in order to empower European CSIRTS and is meant to address several topics of community management.

Included topics are community centric contact databases, intra-organisation interconnection management, local tool orchestration and much more.
