---

Interoperability between CTI standards is key to ensure flow of threat intelligence between sharing communities, CTI pipelines and detection engineering teams. MISP-STIX is a Python library (>=3.7) to handle all the conversions between the [MISP standard format](https://www.misp-standard.org/) and [STIX formats](http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/). The talk will include the challenges and how misp-stix was implemented to provide a generic Python library to support the different formats and the conversions.
