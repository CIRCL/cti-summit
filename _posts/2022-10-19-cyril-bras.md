Whaller is proposing a european communication and collaboration platform. At Whaller, data protection, security and respect are fundamental. The platform is built on the basis of Privacy by Design and gives users total control of their data. In this context, it was natural for us to find a way to share informations about malicious activity with our customers and partners.
