We are seen in the last few years a democratization of telecom signalling attacks. State actors joining forces with large surveillance companies and rogue operators. Over the last year we have been investigating and trying to retrace who are hidding behind the malicious nodes we see everywhere attacking our networks. This presentation will retrace a part of this story mixing OSINT and HUMINT. PS: Slides will be updated before a potential presentation as research is still in progress
