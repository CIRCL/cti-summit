- name: Faezeh Jahanshiri
  bio: "My name is Faezeh Jahanshiri. I am a librarian, and work at the Central Library of Rochester. I’m very interested in computer programming and computer science, in-general, for instructional and educational purposes. I began studying computer programming a few years ago when I was attending the school of information at the San Jose State University in California while I was in the library & information science master’s program. I completed a few computer programming courses and continued learning on my own after I graduated in 2018. I have been presenting Python programming classes at the Central Library of Rochester since October 2021.These courses are designed for absolute beginners and provide a gateway to coding and programming to help them build a strong foundation in computer programming. The objective is to provide a stepping stone for library patrons of all ages who are interested in learning the basics of coding to break into the world of coding and encourage them to explore many career possibilities in the coding field."
